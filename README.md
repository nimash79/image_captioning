# Semantic-Aware Image Captioning (Multi-Branch Architecture)

This repository contains the full reference implementation of a
multi-branch architecture for semantic-aware image captioning
using object, visual, and scene-graph features.

## Research Context
This work extends ideas from the following accepted conference paper:
"Upgrading LSTM-Attention to a Transformer Decoder for Image Captioning
with Object and Visual Features", ICSPIS (IEEE-indexed).
